# Banking Anomaly Detection System - Business Requirements Document

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

The Banking Anomaly Detection System is an intelligent fraud prevention solution that protects customers and the bank from fraudulent transactions using a three-layered security approach. Think of it as having three security guards working together - each with different expertise - to catch suspicious activities.

## 💡 **Solution Approach**

This system uses **Triple-Layer Protection** - three different detection methods working together:

### **Layer 1: Rule Engine (The Bouncer)**

- **What it does**: Enforces hard business rules and limits
- **Logic**: Blocks transactions that clearly violate bank policies
- **Examples**:
  - Too many transactions in 10 minutes (max 5)
  - Exceeding hourly limits (max 15 transactions)
  - Monthly spending limits based on user history

### **Layer 2: Isolation Forest (The Detective)**

- **What it does**: Uses machine learning to spot unusual patterns
- **Logic**: Learns what "normal" transactions look like and flags outliers
- **Training Data**: 41 features from historical transaction patterns (Updated)
- **Examples**: Unusual amounts, strange timing, different locations

### **Layer 3: Autoencoder (The Behavioral Analyst)**

- **What it does**: Detects subtle behavioral changes in transaction patterns
- **Logic**: Learns to "reconstruct" normal behavior; struggles with abnormal patterns
- **Training Data**: Same 41 features, but focuses on behavioral consistency (Updated)
- **Examples**: Gradual changes in spending habits, account takeover patterns

## 📊 **Key Features Used for ML Training**

Both Isolation Forest and Autoencoder use these **41 intelligent features** (Updated):

### **Transaction Details**

- `transaction_amount` - How much money is being transferred
- `flag_amount` - Whether it's an overseas transfer (higher risk)
- `transfer_type_encoded` - Type of transfer (Overseas, UAE, Quick, etc.)
- `transfer_type_risk` - Risk score for each transfer type
- `channel_encoded` - Which channel was used (mobile, web, ATM)

### **User Behavior Patterns**

- `deviation_from_avg` - How different this amount is from user's normal spending
- `amount_to_max_ratio` - Ratio compared to user's largest transaction
- `rolling_std` - How consistent the user's recent spending has been
- `user_avg_amount` - User's typical transaction amount
- `user_std_amount` - How much the user's amounts usually vary
- `user_max_amount` - Largest transaction this user has made
- `user_txn_frequency` - How often this user makes transactions
- `intl_ratio` - Percentage of user's international transactions

### **Enhanced Behavioral Features (New)**

- `user_high_risk_txn_ratio` - Ratio of high-risk transactions
- `user_multiple_accounts_flag` - Multiple account usage indicator
- `cross_account_transfer_ratio` - Cross-account transfer patterns
- `geo_anomaly_flag` - Geographic anomaly detection
- `is_new_beneficiary` - New beneficiary indicator
- `beneficiary_txn_count_30d` - Beneficiary transaction history

### **Timing Intelligence**

- `hour` - What time of day (0-23)
- `day_of_week` - Which day (0-6)
- `is_weekend` - Weekend transactions are often riskier
- `is_night` - Night transactions need extra scrutiny
- `time_since_last` - How long since the last transaction

### **Enhanced Velocity Tracking (Updated)**

- `recent_burst` - Is there sudden activity?
- `txn_count_30s` - Transactions in last 30 seconds
- `txn_count_10min` - Transactions in last 10 minutes
- `txn_count_1hour` - Transactions in last hour
- `transaction_velocity` - Rate of transaction frequency
- `hourly_total` - Total amount spent this hour
- `hourly_count` - Number of transactions this hour
- `daily_total` - Total amount spent today
- `daily_count` - Number of transactions today

### **Advanced Spending Analytics (New)**

- `weekly_total` - Weekly spending totals
- `weekly_txn_count` - Weekly transaction counts
- `weekly_avg_amount` - Weekly average amounts
- `weekly_deviation` - Weekly spending deviations
- `amount_vs_weekly_avg` - Current vs weekly average
- `current_month_spending` - Current month expenditure
- `monthly_txn_count` - Monthly transaction counts
- `monthly_avg_amount` - Monthly average amounts
- `monthly_deviation` - Monthly spending deviations
- `amount_vs_monthly_avg` - Current vs monthly average

## 🔄 **How the System Works**

### **Decision Flow (Priority Order)**

1. **Rule Engine First**: Hard blocks for clear violations
2. **Isolation Forest Second**: ML-based anomaly scoring
3. **Autoencoder Third**: Behavioral pattern analysis
4. **Final Decision**: Combined result with detailed reasons

### **Model Architecture (Updated)**

- **Training Files**: `backend/train_isolation_forest.py`, `backend/train_autoencoder.py`
- **Inference Files**: `backend/isolation_forest.py`, `backend/autoencoder.py`
- **Model Storage**: `backend/model/` directory
- **Feature Configuration**: `backend/utils.py` (centralized features)

### **Example Transaction Flow**

```python
New Transaction → Rule Check → ML Analysis → Behavioral Analysis → Decision
     ↓              ↓            ↓              ↓              ↓
  $5,000 UAE    No violations   Slightly      Normal         APPROVED
  transfer      detected        unusual       behavior       with monitoring
```
